## Introduction

When you invest in a new firm, you want it to be profitable for you as the investor. However, there are many unknowns in the market for new businesses, such as where to invest, where to position it, what category it should go under, and how to identify the customer base or target market. There are merely just few ways to find out or answer to these questions. One of the most prominent is Yelp, where you can find reviews and ratings for multiple businesses from any location.
Yelp is a global online review network, including restaurants, shopping malls, hotels, and tourism businesses around the world. Users can rate merchants, write reviews, and exchange service experiences on it. The Yelp open-source dataset is the official dataset for scientific research and machine learning competitions produced by Yelp Inc. 908,915 tips by 1,987,897 users. Over 1.2 million business attributes like hours, parking, availability, and ambience.
